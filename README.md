## Game Introduction

Splatoon-demake is a modified version adapted for browser of the succesful Nintendo game called Splatoon.
It is a 2D multyplayer platform-shooter which consists of two teams of Inklings fighting each
other with Ink guns. Every player will have a weapon, and it will deal damage if it hits the enemy team,
otherwise it will ink the ground with the color of your team, this will allow you to 
transform into a squid and swim through the inked surfaces with boosted speed while
also being able to climb up walls. Moreover, while you are in the 
"swimming" state, your weapon will rechargue.
Once the timer finishes, the team that has more percentage of ground covered by ink will be 
the winner of the match.
