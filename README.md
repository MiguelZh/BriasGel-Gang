browser-playable 2D platformer.**

## Game Introduction

Splatoon-demake is a modified version adapted for browser of the succesful Nintendo game called Splatoon.
It is a 2D multyplayer platform-shooter which consists of two teams of Inklings fighting each
other with Ink guns. Every player will have a weapon, and it will deal damage if it hits the enemy team,
otherwise it will ink the ground with the color of your team, this will allow you to 
transform into a squid and swim through the inked surfaces with boosted speed while
also being able to climb up walls. Moreover, while you are in the 
"swimming" state, your weapon will rechargue.
Once the timer finishes, the team that has more percentage of ground covered by ink will be 
the winner of the match.

## How To Play
Splatoon-demake is a local 1v1 where one player uses the keyboard and the other a gamepad. You can find the controls on the game page (Link below). You can move, jump, shoot in front of you and diagonally upwards and downwards and transform into skidform to swim through your ink and recharge your weapon.

## Why Would I Play
Splatoon-demake is a simpler and more accessible version of Splatoon that encapsulates the core mechanics of the game in shorter and more focused matches. It also allows for local multyplayer.
